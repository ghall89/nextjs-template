# NextJS Template README

This is a simple template that you can use to start a new Next.js project, with some of my preferred dependencies included. It includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations to get started quickly.

## Features

This template includes the following out of the box:

- TypeScript
- ESLint and Prettier configs
- TailwindCSS
  - `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` included!
- HeadlessUI
- HeroIcons

## Getting Started

1. **Create Project:**
   To create a new NextJS project with this template, run `bunx create-next-app -e https://github.com/ghall89/nextjs-template my-project-name`.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the new directory and install the project dependencies by running `bun install`

3. **Start the Development Server:**
   Run `bun run dev` to start the development server. This will open your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`, where you can see the live preview of your app.

4. **Customize Configuration:**
   You can customize this template according to your requirements by editing the configuration files in the `next.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js` files.

5. **Building for Production:**
   To build your application for production, run `bun run build`. The output will be stored in the `out/` directory.
